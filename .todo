Features:
    ☐ Make a browser app instead of CLI
    ☐ Implement automatically creating the databases
    ☐ Add option to gather all possible information with only 1 api call to make the app faster
        - Can't get release group's artist-credit and maybe others
    ☐ Replace `ratings` by `user ratings`
        - Also implement updating user MusicBrainz `ratings` and `tags` directly from Notio
    ☐ Add `secondary type` to releases
    ☐ Implement threading/async
    ☐ Add remove artist option (remove all its releases that have no artist remaining in the database)
    ☐ Add update all option to update all artists and clean all releases and recordings that have not just been added

Bugs:
    ☐ Missing album covers (perhaps redirection is not needed?)
    ☐ Temp data file is not deleted after downloading if there is an error; implement with builtin `tempfile` module

Code Improvement:

    ☐ Checking if we raise errors when exception is caught
